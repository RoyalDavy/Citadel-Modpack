# Hardhome
 building_type_hardhome_01:0 "Hardhome (Ruins)"
 building_type_hardhome_01_desc:0 "Centuries ago, Hardhome had been halfway toward becoming a town, the only true town north of the Wall, until the night hell had swallowed it. If stories are to be believed, the settlement was consumed by flames so bright, the Black Brothers thought the sun was rising from the north; ashes rained down upon the Haunted Forest and the Shivering Sea for nearly half a year.\n\nWhat truly happened remains uncertain; accounts vary and wilderness had reclaimed the ruins since. According to rangers of the Night's Watch, this unholy place is haunted by ghouls, demons and burning ghosts.\n\nDue to its strategic position however, perhaps what now lies in rubble could be turned into a beacon for the Free Folk once more. The land does not lack in resources, and the nearby bay is deep enough to accommodate large ships.\n\nRebuilding Hardhome would be costly, and it would certainly take a strong leader to convince other chieftains to resettle the ruins despite its past."

Protected by walls, the buildings within are made of sturdy wood, designed to withstand the harshest of winters. Ships that make it past the Shivering Sea visit the nearby bay, bringing goods and valuable supplies for trade.\n \nAlthough dangers still lurk in the unforgiving wilderness that surrounds them, the Free Folk know they can face them together, if they stay united."

The tables are old wine casks, grey and worm-holed and the seating is a spase set of stools and a bench. No geese are in evidence buth the promised stink pervades everything - mostly of wine, damp and mildew, but there is a little of the privy too and something of the lichyard.  The proprietor is a slatternly woman, round and pale and balding, with huge soft breasts that sway beneath a soiled smock. She looks as if the gods have made her out of uncooked dough, and she sometimes stands behind a plank that has been placed across two barrels.
