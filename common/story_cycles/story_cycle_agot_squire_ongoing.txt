	## This system: every year, after the age limit for squirehood (22), a squire recieves an increment to the variable 'years_as_squire'. 
	## if this variable is >= to 15 years of being a squire, they will have their squirehood cancelled.
	## ages 9-22, the age range for squirehood, is a 13 year period where the character is expected to finish their squirehood journey. 
	## We round 13 up to 15 to give leverage to any straggler, but still eligible, characters. 15 years as a squire and it's like, what are you even doing bro?
