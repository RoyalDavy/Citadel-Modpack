# Dragon filler works by having a hidden event on the dragon which then sends the real
# event to either the dragon, its owner, or the dragon's location owner. These should
# be arranged in sequence in order to maintain readability.
#
# As these necessitate many handler events, please write the id of the hidden event
# that should be called on the dragon in the on_action for all events in this file below:
